# 002-Library-System


Welcome to the Library System project! This project simulates a basic library management system where you can add books, register members, lend books, and accept returned books. The project is built using Java and utilizes the `io` library for input and output operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

### Running the Tests

1. Ensure you have JUnit set up in your project. If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can add JUnit as a dependency through your project's build tool (e.g., Maven).

2. Run the tests to ensure everything is set up correctly. You can run the tests from your IDE or using the command line.

    To run the tests from the command line, navigate to the project directory and use the following command:

    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

### Instructions

    This project focuses on encapsulation and the fundamentals of Java programming. Encapsulation, a core concept in object-oriented programming, is utilized to bundle data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, typically a class. This approach not only enhances data security by restricting direct access but also simplifies code maintenance and readability. Alongside encapsulation, the project covers essential Java basics, providing a solid foundation for beginners to understand and implement key programming principles effectively.
